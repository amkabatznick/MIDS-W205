We found the following 10 procedures had the highest variability among hospitals:


For our scoring metric, we looked at the standard deviations in score for most of the measures in the the my_effective_care database. We excluded several items, for reasons we give further discussion to this later in this analysis.

We excluded


because...

All of the remaining metrics we evaluate have scores that are measured in a consistent unit (%). As a result, we are comfortable using SD as our variability metric. Also, when comparing our results to the average standard deviations of all measures (7.8%) our outcomes are significantly higher, given us further confidence in our analysis.
