We have identified these 10 hospitals as models of high quality care, as they possessed consistently high scores across a variety of procedures.

As our scoring metric, we picked the hospitals that had a minimum total score of the variables listed below, which can all be found in the my_readmissions table:

MORT_30_CABG
MORT_30_COPD
MORT_30_HF
MORT_30_PN
MORT_30_STK
READM_30_CABG
READM_30_COPD
READM_30_HF
READM_30_HIP_KNEE
READM_30_PN
READM_30_STK
READM_30_HOSP_WIDE

We only looked at hospitals that were scored in all of these variables to eliminate specialty hospitals which excelled in one particularly area of treatment, but did not offer broad based care. Additionally, we felt that looking at the totals was a better metric as the scoring was not consistent among the variables, which could result in the average possibly being biased by an outlier in one variable.

To come up with these as our principal scoring metric, we looked through the US Government site for Medicare, and evaluated the 57 metrics they use to compare hopsitals1, and found several of the variables they were using should be excluded from our study for reasons we will touch on a little later in our analysis.  We were comfortable moving forward with only these variables as we felt that hospitals that compared favorably against the national average in Mortality and Readmission across a variety of procedures were clearly outstanding in their patient care as they saved patients lives and were able to do so in a way that mitigate future complications.

As mentioned above, we felt several of the variables the government includes could not viably be included in our analysis. First we excluded the Safety of Care and Efficient Use of Medical Imaging variables, as these metrics were not included in our study. Next we excluded the �Patient Experience� variables from our analysis because a later study asks us to compare our hospital rankings against patient satisfaction, so we concluded that including them in our hospital rankings would bias our results. Additionally we excluded the Effectiveness of Care of variables as they were measured in percentages and the variables were not consistent in the direction with some variables being scored positively and others negatively. Lastly, we excluded the Timeliness of Care variables as we felt it would punish urban hospitals, who were more like to see a large number of patients that rural hospitals and thus may be slower in getting to their patients but ultimately offered high levels of care.
